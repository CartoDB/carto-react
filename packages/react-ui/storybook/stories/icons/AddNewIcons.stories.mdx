# Adding a new icon

Before you start, make sure that:

- Icons that you want to add are not already in our repository.

## Rules for Icons

- Use icons from [Mui library](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/) package instead of download them when possible.
- Ensure you download the icon directly from the [Figma icon library](https://www.figma.com/file/Yj97O00yGzMg1ULcA0WEfl/CARTO-Icons?type=design&node-id=8908-3750&mode=design&t=VRvX20o2KSemoIDJ-4)
- Download it at `24x24px`
- Open the SVG file and...
  - Change the fill property of every `<path>` property from its harcoded color to `fill="currentColor"`
  - Remove the general `fill-opacity` property if exists, but not the ones on path layers.
- Place it at `src/assets/icons`
- Add it as a js component as the example below.
- Name the exported asset/component to the same name it has in Figma.

Note, 24x24 is s general rule. [Ideogram icons](https://www.figma.com/file/Yj97O00yGzMg1ULcA0WEfl/CARTO-Icons?type=design&node-id=9225-2137&mode=design&t=C0uiWZl7YrbbfzEq-0) are at 48x48 and itâ€™s ok to add them at this size.

## Figma considerations

To distinguish between custom and Mui icons, note that the name of a custom SVG icon must start with `custom_` prefix in Figma. Otherwise, it's a MUI5 icon (`MUI_` prefix).

<img src={FigmaIcon} alt='Figma - custom icon' width='600' />

If you have an assets with different `alphas` of the same color, designers normally use opacity levels to get that. So `currentColor` should works too in those cases, but please check it.

Note: that `fill="#EB7F86"` color correspond to `palette/replace`, a placeholder color, not intended to be in the palette, just to display the icons in the library.

## Files optimization

The build does not optimize assets, so it is necessary to run optimize assets manually:

- \*.svg: CLI tool [SVGO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgo).
- \*.png|jpeg|jpg|fig: online tool [Optimizilla](https://imagecompressor.com/).

While using `SVGO`, you should disable `removeViewBox`, as in most cases it breaks the layout of the icon.

You have to validate manually that the icon is not broken after optimization.

## Example

```js
import React from 'react';
import { SvgIcon } from '@mui/material';

export default function ArrowDropIcon(props) {
  return (
    <SvgIcon {...props}>
      <path
        fillRule='evenodd'
        clipRule='evenodd'
        d='M12.5 12.17L9.32998 9L7.91998 10.41L12.5 15L17.09 10.41L15.67 9L12.5 12.17Z'
        fill='currentColor'
      />
    </SvgIcon>
  );
}
```
