# CARTO for React - UI Components
This storybook includes the UI Components for CARTO for React (@carto/react-ui).
They are based on [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), and they include a CARTO theme + custom widgets.

## Storybook Development

### How to add a new Story
Put your `stories.js` files inside the `storybook/stories` folder following the same folder structure as the source files. For example:
`stories/widgets/FormulaWidget.stories.js` for `react-widgets/src/widgets/FormulaWidget.js` component.

As long as we are using a decorator to inject the MaterialUI theme, you just need to import and add your component to the `template` of your story.
```js
import React from 'react';
import FormulaWidget from '../../../../react-widgets/src/widgets/FormulaWidget';

const Template = (args) => <FormulaWidget {...args} />;
```

Then, export your story and the different variations:
```js
export default {
  title: 'Widgets/FormulaWidget',
  component: FormulaWidget,
  // We use a decorator for mocking the Redux store
  decorators: [(Story) => <Provider store={store}><Story /></Provider>]
};

const DEFAULT_PROPS = {
  id: 'sb-formula-id',
  title: 'wrapper title',
  dataSource: 'sb-data-source',
  column: 'sb-column',
  operation: 'sum'
};

export const Default = Template.bind({});
Default.args = DEFAULT_PROPS;
```

Optionally, you can add some extra controls to your story, but by default Storybook will add automatic controls for your story arguments.
