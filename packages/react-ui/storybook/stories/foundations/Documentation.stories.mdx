# CARTO MUI theme

[carto-theme.js](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/blob/master/packages/react-ui/src/theme/carto-theme.js) file splitted in sections:

- CSS baseline
- Color palette
- Typography
- Shadows
- Components overrides

Also added some files for shared constants (`themeConstants.js`) and useful functions (`themeUtils.js`).

Removed unused custom `createTheme` function in `carto-theme.js`.

## theme.spacing

We have a new custom spacing constant in carto-theme, `spacingValue`, which you should use instead of the common `theme.spacing()` function in cases where you need to do value calculations, because since Mui v5, theme.spacing is no longer a number, but a string in this format: `number + px`.

Note that if you're using `calc()` in your styles, you can keep using `theme.spacing()` as usual.

`theme.spacingValue * 2`

Needed changes:

1. Change `${theme.spacing(xx)}px` by `${theme.spacing(xx)}`. It means, without the `px` ending, since in Mui v5 it is appended to the end of the string by default.

Tip: An easy search to catch up this, would be `)}px`

2. Change `-theme.spacing(xx)` by `theme.spacing(-xx)`. It means, move the negative symbol inside the function.

Tip: An easy search to catch up this, would be `-theme.spacing(`

## Typography styles

`responsiveFontSizes` simplified due we want to resize only a few variants through the theme.

### New variants

- overlineDelicate
- code1
- code2
- code3

### Replaced variants

Replaced variants due they were so specific to some components, these are:

- `charts`: replaced by `theme.palette.overline` + `weight='strong'`

### Font families

For external use: `Open Sans` and `Montserrat` families have been replaced by `Inter` and `Overpass Mono`, you have an example of this in the [`preview-head.html`](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/blob/master/packages/react-ui/storybook/.storybook/preview-head.html) file.

## Colors

### New colors

- `default` variant: new set of neutral colors. Use it instead of `grey palette`.
- `brand palette` with custom CARTO colors for branding.
- We also have a set of `shade` colors (with transparency):
  - `black`
  - `white`

### Deleted colors

Some keys have been removed from [color palette](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/tree/master/packages/react-ui/src/theme) due they are unused:

- activatedOpacity
- hoverOpacity
- disabledOpacity
- selectedOpacity
- focusOpacity
- other, all removed but divider, which is moved to first level

### Replaced colors

Some others have been moved or replaced because they aren't native MUI keys and are so specific to some components, these are:

- `charts`: replaced by `theme.palette.black[%]`
- `primary.relatedLight`: replaced by `primary.background`
- `secondary.relatedLight`: replaced by `secondary.background`.

## Spacing

Design is restringed to a few specific values for spacing, which are:

`0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15`.

## Shapes

Design is restringed to a few specific values for border radius, which are:

`0.5, 1, 1.5, 2`.

Use: `borderRadius: theme.spacing(x)`

## Shadows / Elevations

Design is restringed to a few specific values for shadows, which are:

`0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24`.
