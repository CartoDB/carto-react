# Typography

## C4R component

We have our own [Typography](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/blob/master/packages/react-ui/src/components/atoms/Typography.js) component that uses `Mui Typography` and extends it with some styling props:

- weight
- italic

This way we can be more flexible regarding text styles without adding too many variants to the theme, an avoiding the same customizations over and over again.

In short, instead of Mui Typography, the component you should use to add text is this one:
`react-ui/src/components/atoms/Typography`

For external use: `import { Typography } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

## Responsive

`responsiveFontSizes` simplified due we want to resize only a few variants through the theme.

### New variants

- `overlineDelicate`
- `code1`
- `code2`
- `code3`

### Replaced variants

Replaced variants due they were so specific to some components, these are:

- `charts`: replaced by `theme.palette.overline` + `weight='strong'`

### Font families

For external use: `Open Sans` and `Montserrat` families have been replaced by `Inter` and `Overpass Mono`, you have an example of this in the [`preview-head.html`](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/blob/master/packages/react-ui/storybook/.storybook/preview-head.html) file.
