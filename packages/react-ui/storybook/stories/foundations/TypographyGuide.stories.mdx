# Typography

`responsiveFontSizes` simplified due we want to resize only a few variants through the theme.

### New variants

- `overlineDelicate`
- `code1`
- `code2`
- `code3`

### Replaced variants

Replaced variants due they were so specific to some components, these are:

- `charts`: replaced by `theme.palette.overline` + `weight='strong'`

### Font families

For external use: `Open Sans` and `Montserrat` families have been replaced by `Inter` and `Overpass Mono`, you have an example of this in the [`preview-head.html`](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/blob/master/packages/react-ui/storybook/.storybook/preview-head.html) file.
