# Spacing

Design is restringed to a few specific values for spacing, which are:

`0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15`.

## theme.spacing

We have a new custom spacing constant in carto-theme, `spacingValue`, which you should use instead of the common `theme.spacing()` function in cases where you need to do value calculations, because since Mui v5, theme.spacing is no longer a number, but a string in this format: `number + px`.

Note that if you're using `calc()` in your styles, you can keep using `theme.spacing()` as usual.

`theme.spacingValue * 2`

Needed changes:

1. Change `${theme.spacing(xx)}px` by `${theme.spacing(xx)}`. It means, without the `px` ending, since in Mui v5 it is appended to the end of the string by default.

Tip: An easy search to catch up this, would be `)}px`

2. Change `-theme.spacing(xx)` by `theme.spacing(-xx)`. It means, move the negative symbol inside the function.

Tip: An easy search to catch up this, would be `-theme.spacing(`
