# Palette

### New colors

- `default` variant: new set of neutral colors. Use it instead of `grey palette`.
- `brand palette` with custom CARTO colors for branding.
- We also have a set of `shade` colors (with transparency):
  - `black`
  - `white`

### Deleted colors

Some keys have been removed from [color palette](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/blob/master/packages/react-ui/src/theme/sections/palette.js) due they are unused:

- `activatedOpacity`
- `hoverOpacity`
- `disabledOpacity`
- `selectedOpacity`
- `focusOpacity`
- `other`, all removed but `divider`, which is moved to first level

### Replaced colors

Some others have been moved or replaced because they aren't native MUI keys and are so specific to some components, these are:

- `charts`: replaced by `theme.palette.black[%]`
- `primary.relatedLight`: replaced by `primary.background`
- `secondary.relatedLight`: replaced by `secondary.background`.
