# Upgrade to the new design system

# Breaking changes in Mui v5

Please, follow the `Mui official guides` related to breaking changes in components and styles:

- [Styles](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/v5-style-changes/)
- [Components](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/v5-component-changes/)

# CARTO MUI theme

[carto-theme.js](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/blob/master/packages/react-ui/src/theme/carto-theme.js) file splitted in sections:

- CSS baseline
- Color palette
- Typography
- Shadows
- Components overrides

Also added some files for shared constants (`themeConstants.js`) and useful functions (`themeUtils.js`).

Removed unused custom `createTheme` function in `carto-theme.js`.

## theme.spacing

We have a new custom spacing constant in carto-theme, `spacingValue`, which you should use instead of the common `theme.spacing()` function in cases where you need to do value calculations, because since Mui v5, theme.spacing is no longer a number, but a string in this format: `number + px`.

Note that if you're using `calc()` in your styles, you can keep using `theme.spacing()` as usual.

`theme.spacingValue * 2`

Needed changes:

1. Change `${theme.spacing(xx)}px` by `${theme.spacing(xx)}`. It means, without the `px` ending, since in Mui v5 it is appended to the end of the string by default.

Tip: An easy search to catch up this, would be `)}px`

2. Change `-theme.spacing(xx)` by `theme.spacing(-xx)`. It means, move the negative symbol inside the function.

Tip: An easy search to catch up this, would be `-theme.spacing(`

## Icons

### Colors

We have this kind of rules in buttons to cover the common use cases:

`svg path { fill: currentColor }`

In case you don't need the icon to be filled, you can apply this class to the svg parent: `.doNotFillIcon`

`<CloseIcon className="doNotFillIcon" />`

### Sizes

We have 3 defined sizes that can be added with the `fontSize` prop of `SvgIcon` component.

- small
- medium (default)
- large

Note: the most common use case is to have the icons at medium size (`18px`), there is only a few exceptions where they use other sizes.

## Typography styles

`responsiveFontSizes` simplified due we want to resize only a few variants through the theme.

### New variants

- overlineDelicate
- code1
- code2
- code3

### Replaced variants

Replaced variants due they were so specific to some components, these are:

- `charts`: replaced by `theme.palette.overline` + `weight='strong'`

### Font families

For external use: `Open Sans` and `Montserrat` families have been replaced by `Inter` and `Overpass Mono`, you have an example of this in the [`preview-head.html`](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/blob/master/packages/react-ui/storybook/.storybook/preview-head.html) file.

## Colors

### New colors

- `default` variant: new set of neutral colors. Use it instead of `grey palette`.
- `brand palette` with custom CARTO colors for branding.
- We also have a set of `shade` colors (with transparency):
  - `black`
  - `white`

### Deleted colors

Some keys have been removed from [color palette](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto-react/blob/master/packages/react-ui/src/theme/sections/palette.js) due they are unused:

- activatedOpacity
- hoverOpacity
- disabledOpacity
- selectedOpacity
- focusOpacity
- other, all removed but divider, which is moved to first level

### Replaced colors

Some others have been moved or replaced because they aren't native MUI keys and are so specific to some components, these are:

- `charts`: replaced by `theme.palette.black[%]`
- `primary.relatedLight`: replaced by `primary.background`
- `secondary.relatedLight`: replaced by `secondary.background`.

## Spacing

Design is restringed to a few specific values for spacing, which are:

`0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15`.

## Shapes

Design is restringed to a few specific values for border radius, which are:

`0.5, 1, 1.5, 2`.

Use: `borderRadius: theme.spacing(x)`

## Shadows / Elevations

Design is restringed to a few specific values for shadows, which are:

`0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24`.

## Tooltip

Now, by default is placed `top` and has an `arrow` indicator, so you don't need to specify these properties anymore.

We have a new component for building data structures within Tooltips, `TooltipData`.

# Components

## Good practices

### ListItem

In order to be interactive, you need to use `MenuItem` component, or use `ListItemButton`instead.

```
<List>
  <ListItemButton>
    <ListItemIcon>
      <Icon />
    </ListItemIcon>
    <ListItemText primary="List item text" />
  </ListItemButton>
<List>
```

```
<MenuList>
  <MenuItem>
    <ListItemIcon>
      <Icon />
    </ListItemIcon>
    <ListItemText primary="List item text" />
  </MenuItem>
<MenuList>
```

To render a link:

```
<ListItemButton component="a">
  <ListItemText primary="List item text" />
</ListItemButton>
```

Note that `<ListItem button />` is deprecated.

## Mui components replacement

These components should be imported from carto-react library instead of Mui, as they replace the Mui components extending their functionality to meet with design criteria.

### Typography

We have a `Typography` component that uses `Mui Typography` and extends it with some styling props:

- weight
- italic

This way we can be more flexible regarding text styles without adding too many variants to the Mui component.

In short, instead of Mui Typography, the component you should use to add text is this one:
`react-ui/src/components/atoms/Typography`

For external use: `import { Typography } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

### Button

We have a `Button` component that uses `Mui Button` and wraps its children in `Typography` to meet with the designed behavior (text overflow case).

So, instead of Mui Button, the component you should use to create buttons is this one:
`react-ui/src/components/atoms/Button`

For external use: `import { Button } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

### AppBar

We have a custom component to build the basic structure and styles on top of AppBar Mui component.

This component normalize size and position of common elements like:

- Logo
- Texts
- Avatar
- Burger menu icon

Use `<AppBar /> ` from: `react-ui/src/components/organisms/AppBar`

For external use: `import { AppBar } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

### Avatar

We have an `Avatar` component that uses `Mui Avatar` and extends it with a new styling prop:

- size

This component normalize `size` and allow us to use only the 4 sizes defined by the design system:

- large
- medium
- small
- xsmall

Use `<Avatar /> ` from: `react-ui/src/components/molecules/Avatar`

For external use: `import { Avatar } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

### TextField

We have a `TextField` component that uses `Mui TextField` and extends it with some extra props:

- readOnly

This way, we can apply custom styles to the whole component and not just the Input, for readOnly fields. More info here: https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/9790

In short, instead of Mui TextField, the component you should use is this one:
`react-ui/src/components/atoms/TextField`

For external use: `import { TextField } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

## New components

These components provide extra functionality to meet the design specs, but they don't exist in Mui library.

### PasswordField

This component build the show / hide content logic on top of TextField Mui component.

Instead of `<TextField type='password' /> ` you should use:
`react-ui/src/components/atoms/PasswordField`

For external use: `import { PasswordField } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

### SelectField

This component adds the `placeholder` logic on top of Select Mui component.

Instead of `<TextField select /> ` or `<Select />` you should use:
`react-ui/src/components/atoms/SelectField`

For external use: `import { SelectField } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

### MultipleSelectField

This component adds the `multiple selection` logic on top of SelectField component.

Instead of `<Select multiple /> ` you should use:
`react-ui/src/components/atoms/MultipleSelectField`

For external use: `import { MultipleSelectField } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

### UploadField

This component is used to display and input `type='file'`.

We are replacing our old `InputFile` component by this new `UploadField`.

Instead of `<Inputfile /> ` you should use:
`react-ui/src/components/molecules/UploadField`

For external use: `import { UploadField } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

### LabelWithIndicator

Designers had the need to mark inputs as `optional` or `required` depending on the use case. That is, in some forms, we have the optional ones marked but in others the required ones.

Mui only provides a `required` bool prop to mark an input as mandatory. When is true, add an asterisk at the end of the label and the validation logic.

We removed the asterisk in the theme, and handle both, required and optional indicators, with this new component. So we can use the following:

Required

```
<TextField
  {...props}
  label={<LabelWithIndicator label={label}  type='required' />}
/>
```

Optional

```
<TextField
  {...props}
  label={<LabelWithIndicator label={label} />}
/>
```

Use `<LabelWithIndicator /> ` from: `react-ui/src/components/atoms/Avatar`

For external use: `import { LabelWithIndicator } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

### AccordionGroup

Component used as a container of a group of `Mui Accordions`, that also add a `variant` prop to have different styles in the group.

Available variants:

- Standard (default)
- Outlined

Use `<AccordionGroup /> ` from: `react-ui/src/components/molecules/AccordionGroup`

For external use: `import { AccordionGroup } from '@carto/react-ui';`.

# Testing

Mui5 has changed the DOM tags, so this is causing some E2E test to fail.

## Aria attributes

Mui5 has improve the `accesibility` of many of the components, adding by default some attributes to the DOM, like aria-label.

This can cause some tests to fail if `aria-label` is not correctly created, because if this attribute is present, `Playwright` will check its content rather than the text of the node itself.

## Tabs

Some tests rely on tab clicking, but with the new design, the click is disabled on selected tab. So, if your test fails in an assert like this:

`await page.getByRole('tab', { name: 'Map' }).click()`

Before the click, yo have to check if the tab is selected.

We have an `isAriaAttributeValue` function in `@utils/ariaAssertions` to check for some aria tags not supported by default by Playwright.

This assert will pass:

```
  const MapPreviewTab = page.getByRole('tab', { name: 'Map' })

  if (await isAriaAttributeValue(MapPreviewTab, 'selected', 'false')) {
    await MapPreviewTab.click()
  }
```
